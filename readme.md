# Xamarin bindings for the Android Cognitive Services Speech SDK

As part of the [Microsoft Cognitive Services speech API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/?WT.mc_id=speech-github-jabenn), there is a native Java Android SDK available as a`.aar` file. I wanted to use this in a Xamarin app, so created a binding project for it.
